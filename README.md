## 🎯 Problem Statement

- YouTube already provides a `genre_name` list for videos.  
- However, identifying the correct **niche** from a YouTube transcript is highly complex.  
- Video transcripts are often **versatile and context-rich**, meaning a single video can belong to **multiple niches within one genre**.  
- Performing this task **manually is difficult, time-consuming, and inconsistent for humans**, especially when analyzing large volumes of transcript data.

## 💡 Solution

Built an **Automated N8N Workflow** using an **LLM model** to intelligently analyze YouTube transcripts and identify niches.

### Workflow Process

1. **Transcript Understanding**
   - The LLM analyzes the **context, meaning, and nuances** of the YouTube transcript.

2. **Genre-Based Niche Generation**
   - Based on the available YouTube `genre_name` list, the LLM automatically decides **which genre the transcript belongs to**.
   - The model then generates **relevant niches** for that genre.

3. **Multiple Niche Handling**
   - Since one genre may contain **multiple related niches**, the system generates several niche candidates.

4. **Niche Grouping with Machine Learning**
   - Applied the **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm** to group similar niches together.

5. **Final Niche Selection**
   - After grouping, the workflow assigns a **single representative niche name** for each genre, which becomes the final selected niche.

# 🔗 Project Suite Overview

This system consists of **three standalone FastAPI projects**, each responsible for a specific stage in the **genre-wise niche grouping workflow**. These services are **linearly connected**, meaning the output of one becomes the input for the next.

---

## 1️⃣ Niche_List_Grouping_Part_1_GenreWise_Recursive

📌 This is the first project in the pipeline. It processes each genre and its associated niches, performs clustering, generates cluster names, and saves the output into a PostgreSQL table named `genre_pillar_niche_mapped_view`(View Table).

## 2️⃣ Niche_List_Grouping_Part_2_GenreWise_Recursive (🔥 Current Project)

### 🔹 Part 2: Final Niche Selection (Using KNN)

#### **Input**
A batch of JSON records containing:
- **One Genre**
- **Multiple Raw Niches**

#### **ML Processing with KNN**
Since one genre may have multiple niche variations:

- The **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** model groups similar niches together.
- Multiple related niches of the same genre are clustered into meaningful groups.

#### **Example**
```text
AI Tools
AI Productivity
Generative AI
Machine Learning
↓
Grouped as → "Artificial Intelligence"
```

#### **Final Niche Naming**
- After grouping, the system assigns a **representative group name**.
- That group name becomes the **final niche of the genre**.
- The **raw generated niches are removed**, and only the **final grouped niche** is retained.

#### **Final Output**
```json
{
  "genre": "Technology",
  "niche": "Artificial Intelligence"
}
```

At the initial step, this project takes clustered data from the `genre_pillar_niche_mapped_view`(View Table) table and calculates an average embedding for each cluster (i.e., for the collection of niches within a cluster). These averaged embeddings are prepared and used in the next stage of the pipeline.

In this stage, data is retrieved from the `genre_pillar_niche_mapped_view`(View Table) in the database, which includes the `genre_name`, the associated `generated_cluster_name` (Pillar Name), and a list of corresponding niches. The project processes this data to compute the **average (mean) embeddings** for each cluster using a FastAPI service exposed at the endpoint:


**🖥️ API Endpoint:**  
`http://192.168.1.242:8002/rebuild_cluster_embeddings`

### ✅ Response Example
```json
[
  {
    "Genre_Name": "Adventure",
    "Subclusters": [
      {
        "Generated_Cluster_Name": "Extreme Exploration",
        "Cluster_Embedding": [-1, 0, 4, 6, 8, -2, -6, 8],
        "List_Of_Niches_In_The_Cluster": [
          { "Niche_Name": "High-Altitude Exploration", "Semantic_Similarity": 0.89 },
          { "Niche_Name": "Offbeat Destinations", "Semantic_Similarity": 0.87 },
          { "Niche_Name": "Mountain Trekking", "Semantic_Similarity": 0.90 }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

---

✅ The resulting cluster embeddings are saved to a file named ClusterEmbeddingCollector.json, which is stored within Docker and prepared for use in the next stage of the pipeline.

In Next Stage, the system then uses these cluster embeddings to determine where new incoming niches best fit. If a new niche closely matches an existing cluster, it is added to that cluster. If no suitable match is found, the system dynamically creates a new cluster, assigns it a name, and calculates its semantic similarity scores accordingly.

The **Part 2 project**, `Niche_List_Grouping_Part_2_GenreWise_Recursive`, serving as the **Main Project**, actively maintaining and updating the niche clustering structure as new data arrives.

---

# Niche Grouping API

## **🌟 Purpose**
- **Utilize precomputed cluster embeddings** 🧠 to efficiently determine the best fit for new incoming niches.
- **Automatically add new niches** ➕ to existing clusters if they meet a semantic similarity threshold.
- **Dynamically create new clusters** 🆕 with generated meaningful names when no existing cluster sufficiently matches a new niche.
- **Continuously maintain and update the niche clustering structure** 🔄 as fresh niche data arrives.
- Enable **scalable and recursive genre-wise clustering** 🔄 to reflect evolving niche landscapes.
- **Support real-time integration** ⏱️ of new niches while preserving cluster coherence and semantic integrity.
- Serve as the **core component** 🔑 of *Niche_List_Grouping_Part_2_GenreWise_Recursive*, driving ongoing niche grouping and management.

---

## **Architecture Overview** 🏗️
The system provides **two main API endpoints** serving different stages of the niche clustering pipeline:

### 1. **Rebuild Cluster Embeddings** (/rebuild_cluster_embeddings/)
- **🎯 Purpose**: 
  - This endpoint is intended to run **only once during the initial setup** and has already been executed.
  - There is no need to run it again, as the `ClusterEmbeddingCollector.json` file already contains data with the cluster vector embeddings in Docker.
  
- **⚠️ Note**: 
  - If Docker is not installed on your computer, manually place the `ClusterEmbeddingCollector.json` in the project directory.
  - Ensure to import this file into the Docker volume at `app/output/ClusterEmbeddingCollector.json`.
  
- **📥 Input**: 
  - A **JSON list** of grouped niches, each containing:
    - Genre name
    - Cluster name (generated cluster name)
    - Niche names within those clusters
  
- **🔄 Process**: 
  - Recomputes the average of the **cluster-level semantic embeddings**.
  - Builds a structured output containing:
    - Genre
    - Cluster embeddings (vector representations)
    - Clusters with semantic similarity placeholders
  - Updates the persistent JSON file (`ClusterEmbeddingCollector.json`) to store these embeddings for future matching.
  
- **📤 Output**:
  - Stored JSON file (`ClusterEmbeddingCollector.json`) containing genres, clusters, cluster embeddings, and niches inside each cluster.
  - This serves as the baseline embedding dataset for matching new niches in future operations.

---

### 2. **Match New Niches** (/match_new_niches/)
- **🎯 Purpose**: 
  - This is the main ongoing endpoint used in the system lifecycle. It processes new incoming niches to integrate them into the existing clustering structure.

- **📥 Input**: 
  - A **JSON list** of new niche entries, each with:
    - Genre name
    - Niche name

- **🔄 Process**:
  1. **📂 Load Existing Cluster Embeddings**:
     - Reads the existing cluster data and embeddings from the stored file `ClusterEmbeddingCollector.json`.
     - This file contains:
       - Genres
       - Generated cluster name
       - Cluster embeddings (vector representations)
       - Niches already grouped inside each cluster with similarity scores
     
  2. **🛠️ Prepare Data Structures**:
     - Groups incoming new niches by genre for efficient processing.
     - Ensures data is sorted and cleaned for consistent embedding generation.
     
  3. **📦 Load Models**:
     - Loads (or uses cached) pre-trained models:
       - **Embedding model** for niche text to vector conversion.
       - **Naming model** (FLAN-T5) for generating cluster names when needed.
       - **Similarity model** for semantic similarity calculations.
     
  4. **🧑‍💻 Generate Embeddings for New Niches**:
     - Uses the **embedding model** to create embeddings (dense vector representations) of all incoming new niches in batches.
     - Embeddings capture the semantic meaning of each niche name.
     
  5. **🔍 Match New Niches to Existing Clusters**:
     - For each new niche embedding:
       - Compute **cosine similarity** with all cluster embeddings in the corresponding genre.
       - Identify the cluster with the highest similarity score.
     
  6. **🏷️ Determine Cluster Assignment**:
     - If the best similarity score ≥ threshold (e.g., 0.55):
       - Assign the niche to this existing cluster.
       - Append the niche along with its similarity score to the cluster's niche list.
     - If the best similarity score < threshold:
       - Create a new cluster for this niche.
       - Generate a concise, meaningful cluster name using the naming model.
       - Add the new cluster embedding and niche list entry (with similarity score 1.0).
     
  7. **💾 Update Cluster Embedding Data**:
     - Update the **in-memory cluster data** with new assignments and any newly created clusters.
     - Persist the updated cluster embeddings and niche data back to `ClusterEmbeddingCollector.json`.
     
  8. **🔙 Return Response**:
     - Send a **JSON response** confirming matching is complete.
     - Include the updated clusters in the response for immediate downstream use if needed.
